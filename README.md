# C-by-Kerningham-and-Ritchie-Soln
## Brief Introduction
The repository contains solutions to the exercises given in the book- C Language by Kerninghan and Ritchie. Though I have given a detailed solution and approach, please try the questions first, and then look at the solutions.
## How to approach the solution?
The basic approach to the solution in the exercises are-
### Step 1</br> 
**Hint->** A text file that contains hints to the exercises viz explanation of technical terms and jargons (well mostly that, yeah)
### Step 2</br> 
**Solution->** Don't be a bummer to look directly into it ;__;
